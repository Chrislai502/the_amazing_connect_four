Here is a list of words: apple, banana, orange, grape, car, truck, plane, train. Group four of these words based on their similarities and explain your reasoning.

First, let's examine each word to identify potential categories. Some of these words might be natural objects, while others are likely man-made. 

Next, we'll separate them based on these characteristics:
- Apple, banana, orange, and grape are all natural and edible. They are fruits, which grow on trees or vines.
- Car, truck, plane, and train are all designed for transportation. They are man-made and used to move people or goods.

From this analysis, we can group the first four—apple, banana, orange, and grape—as fruits. The remaining words belong to the category of vehicles.
