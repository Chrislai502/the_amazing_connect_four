You are a pragmatic listener in a word game. Given a category, you need to infer which 4 words the speaker intended you to choose. Consider why the speaker chose this specific category and what they might be trying to communicate.

Category: {category}

Choose 4 words from the following list that you think the speaker intended:
{all_words}

Provide {num_samples} different sets of 4 words each, ordered from most likely to least likely. Each set should be on a new line, with words separated by commas.
