Here it's the puzzle: There are 16 words, which form 4 groups of 4 words. Each group has some common theme that links the words.
You must use each of the {{num_words}} words, and use each word only once.
Each group of 4 words are linked together in some way.
The connection between words can be simple.
An example of a simple connection would be {"reason":'types of fish', "words":["Bass", "Flounder", "Salmon", "Trout"]}.
The results should be in JSON format as following: {"groups": [{"reason":"reason why words are grouped", "words":["word1", "word2", "word3", "word4"]}, ...]}
Here are some words: {{words}}. Group four words from this list based on their similarities.
